# How to use Notion with me, or anyone else for that matter.

When I work with clients, I share a ton of information. All of this information will get lost in your email, which is a waste of both of our times and resources.

Using notion, we can track, sort, find, reuise, and grow our shared knowledge of your marketing, and if we decide to part as friends in the future. You have all of our work saved in one easy spot to continue on your own.

Notion eleminates a lot of emails. Email is a _good_ form of communication but in my opinion its a poor collaboration tool and it's an even worse database. __Don't save emails, save actionable content in Notion__.

The following are all the keyboard short cuts I could find, to help my clients and I get more work done and spend less time learning or wrestling the tools.

Bookmark this page - lol - no one does this anymore do they? Well, every time I learn a new short cut, or feature I'll add it to this page so comeback, be amazed.

<H2 id="overview">Overview</H2>

<Image src="notion-client-site.png" alt="A Screenshot of a blank Notion template, inside https://notion.so" />

When I share the template with you, I'll go ahead and add an icon and cover image, this is simply to differentiate your Notion template from my other clients, you are free to change the icon (profile picture in the above example), name or cover photo (full-width image above) afterwards and if I end up with 2 people exactly the same, I'll introduce you both <3

<H3 id="taskList">Task List</H3>
In my Template, I start with 3 Main items, you can move these around to suit yourself. The first is Task List, which I'll go into more detail below.

<H3 id="numbers">Numbers</H3>
This page is a quick page for "light" tracking of your numbers, goals, etc.

Goal Mailing List has 500 subscribers.
Current subscribers: 278

Next month, update the number. This isn't meant to be something that is a pain to keep updated, its just meant to visually show you, progress over time. You can't get in a scale and see your progress in Marketing. So this kind of pulls some highlights out and puts them upfront for you so you can stay motivated in tough times. There's always tough times.

<H3 id="brandAssets">Brand Assets</H3>
This page is a collection of brand assets (your brand not mine) I will update this over time, so we are working from the same page all time, if you have a Brand Guidelines docuemnt, I'll add it here. Chances are you don't have one, you don't know what that is, and you don't know what your Fonts are etc. I'm going to catalog all of your fonts, colors, logos, logo versions etc, here so when you sign up for a new TikTok account you can update all of your stuff on brand.

<H3 id="overarchingGoal">Overarching Goal (year)</H3>
What's the big thing you want to get done this year, in our work together? Get that first client. Get 1000 comments on your blog. Reach 50,000 unique visitors in one month? What is the goal that fires you up. I use this as a frame for our discussions. If we are way off track from this goal I may ask if the goal has changed. This goal may help add some perspective to issues that will inevitably crop up, but are just not as important as they feel.

<H3 id="professionalGoal">Professional Goal</H3>
The first goal is something we can do this year. It might be a stretch but it is meant to be a short term goal. This professional goal is more aligned with your __Why__ this is business, why this practice, why these clients? Will 20 clients be enough. 2 books? 47,000 people? Where do you see this going?

<H3 id="sessions">Sessions & Meeting Notes</H3>
This page is going to be huge. All of our sessions together will be recorded here. If we meet in person, I'll docuemnt my notes from the session here so you can reflect between sessions. Just like a podcast, any relevant references that came up during our talk: Articles, books, studies, tweets, links to competitors, links to adjacent busiensses etc will get listed here for your convenience. Items in these notes may also turn into tasks either for me, or you on the task List.

The last two sections of the homepage are Platform Details and Marketing Plan.

<Image src="NotionArea2.png" alt="Screen shot of the Marketing Plan and Platform details area of the page" />

<H3 id="platformDetails">Platform Details</H3>
This area is mainly for me. I use this to make all of your websites, channels and tools reacable on one click. Have I mentioned how much I hate email? If you email me that you have a teachable website for your courses and a WordPress site for your blog. I'll take those details out and record them here. This way I don't have to be able to find the email with your links. It's also helpful for clients to see and appreciate just how complex all of these systems are and how many different things are involved.

<Blockquote>You're doing great, and everything you want to achieve is possible!</Blockquote>

<H3 id="marketingPlan">Marketing Plan</H3>

The final section on the homepage is the Marketing Plan. This is a concept derived from Alan Dib's book the 1 Page Marketing Plan. My of my client have no plan. When you have no plan, anything is on plan. This makes it easy to justify inaction or lack of results.

A plan isn't meant to lock you down or reduce your freedom. The plan forces you to think through all of the pieces into one consolidated effort. When something isn't working you change it. The plan forces you to consider other aspects of your marketing as a system instead of separate pieces.

For example. Your website platform of choice matters, if you are going to rely on SEO. It matters way way less if your primary customer acquistion channel is face-to-face networking.

If you ask someone to build you something for money, they'll build it and take that money. You now have a thing, less money, and are not one step closer to your goals. That's what my entire practice was designed to help you solve.

Again, all of the plan stuff, we'll develop together and is yours to keep.

<H2 id="tasks">Task List</H2>

<Image src="taskList.png" alt="Screen shot of several example tasks, which make up the task list. I have not tested Notion for Accessiblity and if you need something specific to be successful we may use all of these concepts wtih one or more alternate tools, if accessiblity is a concern, please let me know" />


<H2 id="make">Make New Things</H2>

All of the above is stuff, I've set up for you. The next list of options are just hints, tips and tricks about how to make your own things in Notion to better serve you.

As we work together feel free to communicate your needs, if you can't figure out how to do something, I'm happy to help. The tools should be saving time, working smarter not a struggle bus so please contact me along the way if you struggle with anything.

To add something new. Tab on the keyboard, or use your mouse to start a new line.

Open the __context menu__ from here we can hit the <Block src="kbkey" text="/" />

<Image alt="Screenshot of the context menu" src="contextMenu.png" />

Inside the context menu, you can select any of the following blocks:

#### Text
Generic text in the normal text size.

#### Page
A complete separate page. usually nested under the page you are currently on, but you can move it somewhere else too.

#### To-Do List
Adds a list, with check boxes. These are cool visual way to check off steps within a larger project. I will use these a lot in tasks we work together as I'd rather keep track of open action in Notion vs my email ðŸ˜Ž

#### Heading 1
This is an `<h1>` title, the largest title on the page.

#### Heading 2
This is a second level heading `<h2>` this is the second level of heading.

#### Heading 3
This is a third level heading `<h3>` this is usally nested within an H2 heading.

Proper heading structure gives the page hiearchy and make it easier to scan the page for content, visually and/or with an assistive technology.

#### Bulleted List
Exactly what you think it is... a list of bullet items.

#### Numbered List
A numbered list, is a list of items that is auto numbered.

#### Toggle List
A toggle list, is similar to the above lists however the content of the list can be hidden away based on clicking on the toggle.
