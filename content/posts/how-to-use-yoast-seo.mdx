This guide is aimed at assisting a novice user with how to use Yoast SEO. If you've been publishing content to your WordPress site with another SEO plugin some of the fields will be similar and much of this may be review.

If you have never optimized content for SEO purposes, this is a going to be fun.

Posting blog posts is good. Don't look at this blog as an example ðŸ¤£ I write and update post for other people and rarely post my own content, but I'm looking to start changing that.

It's important to highligh that search engine optimization, SEO, is just one marketing tactic. Historically all of my business has come from face-to-face networking as socially awkward and introverted as I am... 95% of all of my freelance work can be traced to face to face networking.

COVID-19 ruined my ability to meet new people and as such, I'm increasing my focus on publishing as its a great way to attract new people to you, your ideas, and your brand electronically, i.e. germ and mask free.

## Onward.

Before we get into the guts of how to use the Yoast SEO plugin, let's touch on why this is important.

Every piece of content you publish, a page, a product page, a service description or a blog post, should have some "specific purpose." Don't over analyze this purpose and if you can't come up with a reason for the content, maybe its a journal entry and not a blog post.

If the purpose is to build trust, credibility, share a point of view on a specific topic, elevate voices within your industry (which communcates your values) all of these pieces of content should be "optimized" so search engines can more easily classify them.

Optimization is done by tying the content to a specific keyword, in Yoast this is called the __Focus Keyword__.

}}>SEO Keywords are words, phrases, topics or ideas that describe what your content is about. Think of these as the words or phrases that someone may use on Google, Bing or DuckDuckGo to find content. All of the content, on any of your pages, including: all the images, video, copy, etc. â€” down to simple words and phrases, these are your primary keywords.</dd>

We can use Keyword planning tools to get an idea on the relative strength of our keyword selection.

At a very high level, the below image shows How to use Yoast vs __How to use Yoast SEO__, the later phrase is used between 100-1,000 times per month while __How to use Yoast__ is only searched 10-100 times per month. This is just enough detail to know, that our focus keyword for this post should be How to use Yoast SEO.

Now that we have a Focus Key Word, we can enter it into the Yoast SEO area in our post editor.

Adding a __focus keyphrase__ shown in the image above, will force the UI to update in the background. The only indication of the update is a change in color and as of this writing, is not accessible.

Note the SEO tab and SEO Analysis tabs have orange Icons now. Clicking the __SEO analysis tab__ will open that feature set see image below:

### What's happened now?

Yoast does some analysis behind the scenes and gives the user (that's you) some feedback based on its someone what opinionated point of view about what comprises an optimized peice of content. You can honor all of these, or none of them. Fixing all of the issues listed here is not going to magically skyrocket you to the top of google.

### Important Note about Using Yoast SEO with WordPress

Optimizing your posts will not necessarily skyrocket you to the top, I say this to help manage your expectations. It is important however to recognize some perspective with respect to your site. Completing the above steps is absolutely free, the only thing required is your time.

I've worked with 100s of clients who install the Yoast plugin, check SEO off their list and move on to more important things.

Installing the plugin does virtually nothing for your website.

In some cases, just having the plugin installed and forgetting about it could result in your site getting hacked, taken down or used to run a fake NetFlix sign up form (this happened to a client).

All plugins should have a purpose, should be maintained or should be deleted.
